# lift-basic-30
An example to illustrate some of the unexpected behavior of LiftScreen in Lift 3.0

Have a look at src/main/webapp/houses/create.html, src/main/webapp/houses/create_1.html and the snippets they reference in src/main/scala/code/snippet/SomeScreen.scala

# Running the examples
I think that I might have updated the xsbt-web-plugin to the latest version. Use jetty:start to see the application running (instead of the more traditional container:start)
